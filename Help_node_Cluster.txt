Start Node_Cluster demo

dependencies
npm install cors dotenv express loadtest morgan nodemon 


loadtest command
$ loadtest [-n requests] [-c concurrency] [-k] URL

The URL can be "http://", "https://" or "ws://". 
Set the max number of requests with -n, 
and the desired level of concurrency with the -c parameter.
Use keep-alive connections with -k whenever it makes sense, 
which should be always except when you are testing opening and closing connections.

example
1) loadtest -n 10 -c 10 http://localhost:3000/api/v1/homepage

or 

2) loadtest -n 10 -c 10 http://localhost:3000/api/v1/slowpage
